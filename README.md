General Purpose/Inspiration
===========================

Basically, I saw [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCVAGb1ee8A)
video and decided to do some fun stuff with it :) For future reference,
I believe that the paper referenced is: [The Alcuin Number of a Graph
(PÃ©ter Csorba, Cor A. J. Hurkens, Gerhard J. Woeginger,
2008)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-87744-8_27)

Plan of Action
==============

Graph files
-----------

Just some homemade roleout of networks/graphs (I\'ll call them
NodeGraphs) \*\*
