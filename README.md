General Purpose/Inspiration + Some info!
========================================

Basically, I saw the video [River Crossings (and Alcuin Numbers) by
Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCVAGb1ee8A) and decided to
do some fun stuff with it :) For future reference, I believe that the
paper referenced is: [The Alcuin Number of a Graph (PÃ©ter Csorba, Cor A.
J. Hurkens, Gerhard J. Woeginger,
2008)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-87744-8_27)
Here are some resources I\'m compiling for the projects:

YouTube Videos:
---------------

-   [The first video mentioned
    above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCVAGb1ee8A)

Papers:
-------

-   [Again, the first paper mentioned
    above](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-87744-8_27#citeas)

Textbooks:
----------

-   Get back to me on that one, love.

Plan of Action
==============

Graph files
-----------

Just some homemade roleout of networks/graphs (I\'ll call them Graphs,
consiting of GraphNodes).

### GraphNode

Graph nodes need to know what other nodes they\'re connected to.

Alcuin Files
------------

All the stuff related to solving the river problem. Note that finding
the optimal solution is NP-Hard
